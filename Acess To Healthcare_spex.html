             We all might have heard at least one report on how rural Areas don't have the best facilities for Healthcare. We also know that some in some areas, People Have to walk hundred of meters for a medical center.
            The government has taken several steps to improve the situation, however the effect is not very drastic. Ineffectiveness of the primary health care created a breach in referral system which should serve as an entry point for the individual and continuous comprehensive coordination at all level of health care.
            primary health care in India needs to re-evaluate and immediately warrants reforms and concrete steps to be taken, otherwise this tug of war between growth and human resource development remains will continue forever.
